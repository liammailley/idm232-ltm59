Prepare &amp; cook the beet:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Heat a small pot of salted water to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the <strong>beet</strong> and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch wedges. Once the pot of water is boiling, add the beet wedges and cook, uncovered, 22 to 24 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Drain and rinse under cold water for 30 seconds to 1 minute to stop the cooking process. Pat dry with paper towels and transfer to a large bowl.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.) Prepare the remaining ingredients:</strong></p>\r\n<p>While the beet cooks, cut off and discard the root ends of the <strong>scallions</strong>; thinly slice, separating the white bottoms and green tops. Using a peeler, remove the green rind of the <strong>lime</strong>, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Quarter the lime. Grate the <strong>cheese</strong> on the large side of a box grater. Peel the <strong>orange</strong>; halve lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. To make the lime crema, in a bowl, combine the <strong>crema</strong> and <strong>the juice of 2 lime wedges</strong>; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cut out and discard the stem, ribs, and seeds of the <strong>pepper</strong>; finely chop. Thoroughly wash your hands, knife, and cutting board immediately after handling the pepper.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>3.) Cook &amp; chop the chicken:</strong></p>\r\n<p>While the beet continues to cook, pat the <strong>chicken</strong> dry with paper towels; season on both sides with salt, pepper, and the <strong>spice</strong> <strong>blend</strong>. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken; cook 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Transfer to a cutting board; when cool enough to handle, roughly chop. Transfer to a medium bowl. Rinse and wipe out the pan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.) Make the filling and assemble the quesadillas:</strong></p>\r\n<p>To the bowl of <strong>chopped</strong> <strong>chicken</strong>, add the <strong>sliced white bottoms of the scallions</strong>, <strong>lime zest</strong>, <strong>the juice of 1 lime wedge</strong>, a drizzle of olive oil, and <strong>as much of the chopped pepper as you&rsquo;d like</strong>, depending on how spicy you&rsquo;d like the dish to be. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Place the <strong>tortillas</strong> on a work surface. Sprinkle the <strong>grated cheese</strong> onto 1 side of each tortilla. Evenly top with the filling. Fold each tortilla in half over the filling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>5.) Cook the quesadillas:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium until hot. Add the <strong>quesadillas</strong>; cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until the tortillas are browned and the cheese has melted. (If the pan seems dry, add a drizzle of olive oil before flipping.) Transfer to a cutting board; immediately season with salt and pepper.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>6.) Make the salad and serve your dish:</strong></p>\r\n<p>While the quesadillas cook, add the <strong>sliced</strong> <strong>orange</strong>, <strong>peanuts</strong>, <strong>the juice of the remaining lime wedge</strong>, and a drizzle of olive oil to the bowl of <strong>cooked beet</strong>.
