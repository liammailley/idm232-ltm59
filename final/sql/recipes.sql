Prepare the rice</strong></p>\r\n<p>Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450&deg;F. In a<br>medium pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of<br>water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to<br>low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice<br>is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>2.)

Peel the carrots;<br id=\"isPasted\">quarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise. Peel and roughly chop the garlic.<br>Remove and discard the stems of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a<br>peeler, remove the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2<br>teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve the<br>orange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Whisk in the<br>chile paste and 2 tablespoons of water until smooth.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong id=\"isPasted\">3.) Roast Carrots<br></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Place the sliced carrots on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season<br id=\"isPasted\">with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17<br>minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.) Cook garlic and season rice</strong></p>\r\n<p>While the carrots roast, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2<br id=\"isPasted\">teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic<br>and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add<br>the chopped kale; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally,<br>3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly wilted. Add 1/3 cup of water; season with<br>salt and pepper.

Cook &amp; glaze the chicken</strong></p>\r\n<p>While the carrots continue to roast, pat the chicken dry with paper towels;<br id=\"isPasted\">season with salt and pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons<br>of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4 to<br>6 minutes on the first side, or until browned. Flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or<br>until lightly browned. Add the glaze and cook, frequently spooning the glaze<br>over the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is coated and cooked<br>through. Turn off the heat; stir the butter and the juice of 1 lime half into<br>the glaze until the butter has melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6.) Finish the rice and serve your dish</strong></p>\r\n<p>To the pot of cooked rice and kale, add the lime zest, cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che,<br id=\"isPasted\">raisins, and the juice of the remaining lime half. Stir to combine;<br>season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the glazed chicken with the<br>finished rice and roasted carrots. Top the chicken with the remaining glaze<br>from the pan.
