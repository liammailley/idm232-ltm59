     <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
     <p>
          This class focused around database connections, PHP, and MySql. The purpose of this final project was to demonstrate
          understanding of PHP through the construction of a recipe site.
          <br>Users can view a collection of recipes, and can search for specific ones by using a search bar. An Admin section
          is also included, where one can edit individual recipes, create new recipes, and delete recipes. Finally, a section that
          allows for sorting by category is included. 
     </p>
     <h1>CONTEXT AND CHALLENGE</h1>
     <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
     <p>
          We were given a large amount of complete recipes. These recipes needed to be placed onto a database, then accessed by
          a PHP-powered site that would allow users to view them, and admin users to edit, delete, or add more of them.
     </p>
     <h2>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</h2>
     <p>
          My goal was to create a fully functioning recipe site that could properly display, update, delete, and add to a database of recipes.
     </p>
     <h1>PROCESS AND INSIGHT</h1>
     <p>
          Initially, this task was very daunting for one main reason - I had never worked with PHP before!
          <br><br>
          Moreover, I had never worked on any web development task that was not strictly client-side. Getting my files to communicate with
          a database was something I had never attempted in my time here at Drexel, and it would prove to be the biggest hurdle to cross.
          I spent most of my time trying to familiarize myself with phpMyAdmin, a program used for updating and creating database tables.
     </p>
     <div class="image_box">
          <img class="gif" src="images/phpmyadmin.png">
     </div>
     <p>
          I soon began to understand the ways PHP could communicate with and update databases. To test my abilities, I created a table
          for all "users" of the site.
     </p>
          <div class="image_box">
               <img class="gif" src="images/users.png">
          </div>
     <p>
          <br>
          From here, I replicated the basic ideas of this user table and modified them to reprent each recipe. I also created a "recipes"
          database table. Once this was functioning, I was able to create a more rigid structure for the site.
          <br><br>
          My next step was to implement a search bar, and to allow this search field to look through most aspects of the database
          to find as many matches as possible. Finally, I implemented a standardized placeholder image for all recipes.
     </p>
     <h1>THE SOLUTION</h1>
     <div class="toplink_box">
          <a href="https://liammailley.com/idm232/final/" class="toplink">Try it here!</a>
     </div>
     <h1>THE RESULTS</h1>
          <p>
          After a long and difficult few weeks, I have accomplished the goal of creating a site to host 40 different recipes from a database.
          All can be edited, deleted, or new entries can be added from the "Admin" tab on the navigation bar. In addition, a "Categories" tab 
          is available, which allows users to only see recipes of a certain category (be it breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, or snacks.)
          <br><br>
          I'm very proud of the finished product. This was a challenging assignment in more ways than one, but seeing it come together has
          been amazing. I hope to use my experience from this project to create more complex and more interactive interfaces than
          ever before!
